# Python Sockets Example Project
Basic client/server sockets example using Python, intended for teaching and my own edification.

# Installation Instructions (Ubuntu Linux)
  - Install Git and Python 3.6 or newer if they're not already available: `sudo apt install git python3`
  - Download the project to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/stephen-sorley/python_sockets.git`

# Run Instructions (Ubuntu Linux)
  - Open two terminal windows, then move into the `python_sockets` directory in both.
  - Run `./server.py` in one terminal window, then run `./client.py` in the other.
  - The client and server both use localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and the same port by default.
